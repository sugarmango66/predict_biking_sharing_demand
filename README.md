# Bike sharing demand prediction using AutoGluon

## General Information
In this project, I use the AutoGluon library to train several models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition in Kaggle. I use Tabular Prediction to fit data from CSV files provided by the competition. I train several iterations of models and apply optimization of the problem.
